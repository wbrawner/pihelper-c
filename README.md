# PiHelper

PiHelper is designed to be a simple, lightweight, portable client library for the
[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). There is also a CLI tool available.

## CLI Usage

    -c, --configure              Configure Pi-Helper
    -d, --disable <duration>     Disable the Pi-hole for a given duration, or permanently if empty
    -e, --enable                 Enable the Pi-hole
    -f, --file <config-file>     Use the given config file instead of the default
    -h, --help                   Display this message
    -q, --quiet                  Don't print anything
    -v, --verbose                Print debug logs

## Library Usage

Include the `pihelper.h` file.

## Building

PiHelper depends on cmake, curl, openssl, and json-c. On Fedora you can install the dependencies with the
following command:

    sudo dnf install cmake \
        gcc \
        gcc-c++ \
        libcurl-devel \
        openssl-curl \
        json-c-devel

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can build the project with cmake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

By default, this will build a static library you can link to. If you'd like to build a shared library, use
this cmake command instead:

    cmake -DPIHELPER_SHARED=BOOL:ON ..

If you'd like to have the command line tool as well, you can use this:

    cmake -DPIHELPER_EXECUTABLE=BOOL:ON ..

If you need the development headers on your system, you can run this:

    cmake -DPIHELPER_DEV=BOOL:ON ..

Once you've run cmake with the desired options, you can install pihelper to your system by runnning the
following after building:

    sudo make install
