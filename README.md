## Building

PiHelper depends on cmake, curl, openssl, and json-c. On Fedora you can install the dependencies with the
following command:

    sudo dnf install cmake \
        gcc \
        gcc-c++ \
        libcurl-devel \
        openssl-curl \
        json-c-devel

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can build the project with cmake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

If you'd like to install pihelper to your system, run the following after building:

    sudo make install # This is optional, and only needed if you want to install command line utility
